Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishnupriya-shisode/vishnupriya-shisode/main/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966.gif" width="20">

I’m Vishnupriya, an aspiring software developer based in London.

I like designing and building whatever I can get my hands on, and learning through it.

My main tech stack includes [React](https://react.dev), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (currently learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

My favourite tools are [Procreate](https://procreate.com), [Figma](https://www.figma.com), and [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com) on my iPad.  
For development, I switch between [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Cursor](https://cursor.sh).

Right now, I’m focused on improving my problem-solving skills through LeetCode, learning DSA from scratch, and staying active on GitHub as I build my portfolio.

    The Holiday is my favourite movie
