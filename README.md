Hey there! <img width="206" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bfc2bcf-5a5e-41ec-843f-9ae59535a621" />


Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a Computer Science student with a love-hate relationship with coding — but hey, isn't that part of the journey?😅 
I thrive on challenges, late-night debugging wins, and the thrill of turning an idea into something real.

- 👀 I’m passionate about exploring the intersection of **Cybersecurity🔓** and **Artificial Intelligence🤖**, using **Programming💻** as the bridge between the two.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Advanced Topics in CS**, **Computer & Network Security**, **AI**, and **Mobile/Distributed Systems**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source projects**, **AI-powered apps**, and anything related to **full-stack development** or **digital well-being**.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I once created a full-stack football stats app in under 48 hours at a hackathon (yes, with barely any sleep... and lots of coffee ☕️)!

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to connect or collaborate. Let's build something awesome together! 🚀
