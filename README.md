Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishnupriya-shisode/vishnupriya-shisode/main/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966.gif" width="20">

I’m Vishnupriya, an aspiring software developer based in London.

I like designing and building whatever I can get my hands on, and learning through it.

My main tech stack is React, JavaScript (and currently learning TypeScript), and Tailwind CSS.  
My favourite tools are Procreate, Figma, and GoodNotes on my iPad. For development, I switch between VS Code and Cursor.

Right now, I’m focused on improving my problem-solving skills through LeetCode, learning DSA from scratch, and staying active on GitHub as I build my portfolio.

Fun Facts:

    I love cats 🐈
    long walks are my daily reset 
    The Holiday is my favourite movie
    Hobbies: reading, home workouts, building things
